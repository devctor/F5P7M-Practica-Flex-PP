## My process
I approached the project using the following methods and technologies:

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Kanban](https://github.com/users/devctor/projects/6/views/1) I utilized the Kanban boards feature in GitHub Projects to manage and track the progress of tasks throughout the project.
- [Vite](vitejs.dev) for dev environment and bundle manager.
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) reliable end-to-end testing. 
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) a development platform that includes build, deploy, and serverless backend services for web applications and dynamic websites.

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in testing the user interface using [Playwright](https://playright.dev/) and linting CSS files with [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/).
